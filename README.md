This is simple job-seeker laravel application (not completed) that let the job seker to manage its job application.
 The main features:
 - Custom login page (though the laravel ship with its native login page, but for sake of learning, i create one)
 - Custom register page
 - Bootstrap admin lte 2 used for layout.

For this project I follow the instructions from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFh0Fd7BsjE&t=4912s.
